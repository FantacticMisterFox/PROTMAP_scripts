<p>For our analysis we used two different tandem mass
spectrometry data set. One is a data set from a single
strain E. coli K-12, grown under standard conditions.
The data set consist of seven experimental replicas and
part of the publication [23]. The SIHUMIx datasets are
described in detail in [32]. They comprise 166 indepen-
dent measurements, of which 90 used a standard pro-
tein preparation protocol and the remaining 76 cover
different enrichment protocols to elevate the level of
small proteins in solution.
More than 5.7 million PSMs were analysed for the
project. The search of the SIHUMI data sets against
the 6frame data base (the main analysis to find new
protein candidates) resulted in over 2,5 million PSMs.
Beside different protein enrichment protocols, both
Trypsin and Asp-N were used as different digestive en-
zyms.</p>
